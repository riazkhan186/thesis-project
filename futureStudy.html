                    <p class="para">Most women (64.6%) had a good opinion about using family planning Method. A significant percentage of 35.4% said they had no idea. Attitude was assessed by the  perceived role women played in family planning. [5] Most of the roles given were  positive towards family planning. But they were biased towards men. This positive attitude should be the uterus of family planning managers to increase the rate of
                    contraception in this region. Both quantitative studies and  revealed that some women think that FP is a women’s subject. This approach needs to be considered to improve the scope of family planning 69.1.1% of women feel that men have a role to play in family planning. However, only 17.8% admitted that men
                     should use family planning methods.</p>

                     <p class="para">
                        The remaining percentage thought that women should facilitate their husbands to participate in family planning by discussing with their partners and making decisions for them 17.3%, educating their partners 8.9% Some respondents making decisions for their husbands 1.6% , Especially intermarriage discussions and key informants
                        thought that women should discuss with their husbands and make decisions for them. It shows that women are not willing to involve themselves in the use of family
                        planning methods but they are willing to support their husbands. This misconception began with the way family planning managers targeted mainly women. And most of
                        these services are being provided in maternal and child health clinics.

                     <p class="para">
                        So the family needs to address this concern through a program that integrates women  into planning. Some respondents simply suggested starting a family planning clinic. 30% of respondents used any method of family planning. This was similar to 29% of MICS [medical implant communication service] 2016. Although awareness among
                        women about panning in the family was good, previous uses were low. 29% of respondents ever used the family planning method. The primary motivation for the use of contraception was place delivery. When participants in the interview chapter were asked to define family planning, they often mentioned birth intervals. The economic motive for adopting family panning was often mentioned later because it included ongoing experience such as school fees, and long-term considerations such as medical care as well as protection of inheritance and old age. This was reported by 26.2% of respondents. [6].

                    Women’s motivation projects should be taken up to convince women that family planning is not just for women but for men as well. Family planning services need to be integrated into the rest of the clinics, not just the MCH clinic. Women should be included in MCH packages (Maternal and Child Health).
                    Government policies on family planning should be developed to guide communities and service providers.

                Yes. Strategies must be adopted to increase the survival rate of children so that people are sure that some of the children given to them will survive after birth. Expand district hospitals and health centers and pastors in rural areas to ensure maximum public access to FP services.

                <p class="para">Systematic way to solve any problem. The purpose of a Science I study of how it is scientifically researched is to plan research work. It provides training in problem solving methods, scientific tools and strategy selection.However, more attention needs to be paid to a number of areas to ensure effective family planning in the future: First age of marriage: Between the ages of 20 and 49, 62% of women are below legal age and 23.8% are married by the age of 18. TFR stagnation and contraceptive use: The contraceptive propensity rate (CPR) stands nationally at 2%, but with high regional differences, CPR is much lower in the eastern egion than in the western region of Bangladesh. Married adolescents have lower CPR than other ages, resulting in higher adolescent fertility rates. Excessive reliance on temporary methods of contraception. Currently 8% of married women use the long-acting or standing method. The pill is still the most used method after injection at 27%. In line with the lower rate of LAPM, Bangladesh shows a higher rate of walking. 30% of contraceptive users stop using any method within 12 months of starting, this rate is particularly high among temporary procedure users. More attention needs to be paid to the quality of FP services in both rural and urban areas. Reducing the need for FP services, currently 12% of married women in Bangladesh do not need FP services. 17% of women aged 15-19 do not need it the most.
                The research methodology that was followed for the purpose of this study was persuasive. According to this method, researchers start with specific observations, which are used to generate general theories and conclusions obtained from research. The reason for the possession of the persuasive method is that it considers the context in which research efforts are active, but it is also most suitable for small samples of quality data. The main weakness of the inductive method, however, is that it draws conclusions based on general theory and only a small number of observations

                      Descriptive analysis was performed on all demographic indicators, marital discourse scales, and contraceptive indicators. An unreasonable and adjusted logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the ‘marital discussions on family planning’ and current modern interval contraceptive use and the subcategories of marital discussions on ‘family size’ and ‘contraceptive’ and current modern interval contraceptive use. Adjusted analyzes were performed to control the age of the woman, age difference between the woman and her husband, education, educational difference between the woman and her husband, family income and children ever born. The association ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated to determine the size and significance of the association.

                      That’s when we need to talk about best contraceptive method for newly married couples. Family planning must be discussed. Should we have children? When should we have them? What happens in case of unintended pregnancy?

                    <h5>Family Planning Method</h5>
                    <h6>Oral Pill Combination</h6>

                    <p class="para">
                      Oral pills do not account for more than 30% of couples in the developing world, with minor exceptions in Algeria and Morocco. Bangladesh is close to that clear ceiling. It goes without saying that a second oral pill with various hormonal content is provided to prevent the presented appearances, or only progestin-drugs for postpartum mothers and, of course, unintended contraceptives for pregnant women without resorting to emergency contraception. Clinical methods are declining in both absolute and relative terms.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Implants</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                      These have received some exposure in Bangladesh but never reach significant levels. Now that Multi-rod Norplant has stopped production and new single or dual rod models such as Implanon, Jadel, and Sino-Implant are available, this may be during the promotion of a relatively low cost, low maintenance method which may be a long term temporary method effective.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Pregnancy Contraceptives</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                      With less than one percent of couples, they are virtually non-existent. This method has gained widespread popularity in other developing countries with similar levels of clinical services, but reluctance to adopt IUCD remains widespread in Bangladesh .Historically, there is a perception that Muslim women would not feel comfortable
                      with a procedure that increases bleeding and extends the period of impurity. This is why IUCDs were promoted in the early Muslim FP program only in Hindu Bali, not mainly in the Muslim provinces.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Sterilization</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                      When the motivation given by field workers and agents to recruit tuberculosis clients ceased in the 1980s, the top three of the three disinfection users dropped to one in ten.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Injectables</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                      Injections offer numerous benefits as a long-acting, contraceptive method of contraception.

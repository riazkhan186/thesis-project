                        Most developing countries are experiencing rapid population growth due to high fertility rates. While high birth rates, reduced mortality rates, and the use of lowexpansion and contraception are some of the reasons for the rapid population growth in these countries, contraception is a way to limit pregnancy and place birth in order to achieve a desired family size. Contraception helps improve women's reproductive health thereby reducing maternal and child morbidity. Extensive population data and socioeconomic factors influence the current use of contraceptives through proximal factors such as spatial communication, women's sexual empowerment, access to services and attitudes, and knowledge of family planning. Reproduction is seen as the sole responsibility of women in most parts of the world, although this dual commitment is often forgotten by men by health clients, especially when it comes to family planning services. The role of women in family planning has been gaining more attention recently as population planners around the world have begun to recognize the importance of male influence in reproductive decision making. Men have a direct and major role in contraceptive decision making, but they also have an indirect role as an influential factor in women's lives regarding their own economic, social and family needs. In the above situation, proper research is needed in family planning, because we can only control the situation by proper checks for population growth. [2].

                    <h6>Age of the Respondents</h6>
                    <p class="para">A key demographic variable that is closely related to respondents ’age is fertility and
                    current use of contraception. To better understand the age distribution of respondents,
                    they were analyzed separately for those living in rural areas. The age of the highest
                    number of respondents (39.0%) was between 26-39 years. The second highest number
                    (32.3%) was between the ages of 40-49. Although the third highest number of
                    respondents was aged (27.0%) between the ages of 20-25. Also, (1.7%) age was 15-
                    19 years.</p>

                    <h6>Literacy Status and Level of Education</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        Women’s education levels play an important role in delaying the age of first marriage and creating better employment opportunities. Furthermore, it positively affects women's attitudes towards contraceptive use and puts them in a position to discuss taking contraceptives. In general, the level of illiteracy is high. Surprisingly, the number of illiterate women in Somaliland settings was much higher in almost all regions of the district. In rural areas the average female literacy was about 5.6..667%. However, 43.333% of women in Somaliland are illiterate.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Marital Status</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        Marriage is a law, ceremony or process by which a legal relationship is formed between a man and a woman as husband and wife. The legitimacy of a union may be established by civil, religious or other means recognized by the law of a country.
                        Marriage is generally socially acceptable and respectfully initiates the birth of
                        children. In light of these facts, the marital status of women is considered as an
                        important factor in understanding women’s reproductive behavior. Thus, information
                        was collected about the current marital status of the respondents. 97.0% were married,
                        but 3.0% were divorced / separated.
                        Respondents' religious research showed that all respondents (100%) were Muslims by
                        faith.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Ethnic Background of Respondents</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        The ethnic composition of a population is important because it indicates socio-cultural
                        diversity, which may affect the use of FPs.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Occupation of Respondents</h6>
                    <p class="para">

                    <h6>Personal Income of Respondents</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        The results show that the highest number of respondents was 73.333% with 5000-10000 BDT monthly income as related to personal income. However 19% was 15000-20000BDT per month. Also 8.6667% responded 25000-30000BDT per month.

                    <h6>Age at Married</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        In a population where fertility control is not very extensive, age is very closely related to fertility in the case of first marriage. In this population, women who marry early tend to have an early tendency at childbirth, have long-term lifelong contact during pregnancy, and have a larger family size than those who marry late. In the case of first marriage, age-related information can help planners and program implementers develop strategies to increase the age of first marriage. The average age of Bengali first marriage was less than 1 17 years in common parlance, the present study has shown that 65..6676% was 15-19 years, 32.667% was 20-24 years. 1% was 30-34years .. 0.6667% was 25-29 years.

                    <p class="para">

But 39% had no answer. Yet, despite the high level of knowledge of family planning in the population under consideration, knowledge of long-term and sustainable methods is very low. Indicates that a limited proportion of women in the four regions know about this permanent method.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Source of Family Planning Information</h6>
                    <p class="para">
                        Family planning information can be obtained from partners, relatives or friends, health workers, schools, workplaces, markets, religious institutions, community meetings, or from a variety of sources through print media or radio and TV broadcasts. To identify the main sources of family planning information in the covered areas, respondents with knowledge of at least one method of family planning were asked to report the original source of their information. Other sources such as 52% were media. 43.333% had healthcare / facilities .3.333% had friends. 1.3333% were neighbors. [4]
                    </p>

                    <h6>Reason for Discontinuation of Contraception</h6>
                    <p class="para">

                <div class="four-Summary">
                    <h4 id="c4.4">4.4 Summary</h4>
                    <p class="para">
                        The inquiries provide representative information on knowledge, attitudes, practices, reasons for motivating women's participation in FP, and barriers to the use of FP by adult women living in rural areas. In developing countries, the lack of family planning services for women who want to prevent or postpone future pregnancies inevitably leads to increased maternal mortality, horror rates, and both social and economic costs. Valuable minerals and resources needed to keep. These types of stores of minerals and resources are also criticized for allowing women to endure the process related to delivery. In a country like Bangladesh, high maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR)
                        consider on the one hand why more family planning services are not available and if
                        they are available then why people do not use them.
                        Knowledge is a key factor in influencing attitudes toward use and family planning
                        practices. If people are well informed about the benefits, methods used and their side
                        effects, they can have a positive attitude and the majority will take part. Studies have
                        shown that in many cases women of reproductive age are generally informed about
                        family planning, but do not have a detailed knowledge of their activities and methods
                        of use. One of the reasons for women's patronizing knowledge about contraception
                        lies in their access to information: mainly from the media and informally from
                        relatives and friends. Radios and televisions are often a source of information for
                        women.
                        This was reflected in the current study with slight differences. Most of the
                        respondents in this survey heard about family planning. Most knew the exact meaning
                        of family planning. Knowledge of at least one modern method of family planning.

                <p class="para">Family planning programs often do not provide reproductive and sexual health care. Women of all ages, especially teenage girls, are not present. Reproductive health experts have expressed concern about the government's program to abandon brides and unmarried but sexually active adolescents, according to a New Age report on Sunday. The marriage rate for adolescents is one percent, and the rate of contraceptive use among adolescents is 4 percent. The unreasonable need for contraceptives is even greater among adolescents. Experts blame the poor quality of service at union-level family planning centers and say field workers are not going door-to-door to inform couples about reproductive health and contraceptive preferences. It is the responsibility of the family planning department to manage the centers effectively, but there is a lack of measures to identify failures. Experts also point to the increasing number of sexually active adolescents. The issue is reflected in the level of silence on the level of social bargaining that excludes this category from any reproductive health care. As public centers limit their service to married couples, unsafe and confidential abortions increase in this group. Programs need to be carefully created to allow policy makers to participate in health concerns rather than explicitly approving social silence on the culturally sensitive issue of adolescent sexual health. This silence and limited focus on adult couples is problematic because recently Bangladesh has amended the law to allow a certain amount of child marriage. Many public health workers have been asking the government for decades to convert family planning programs into a reproductive healthcare program. Union health centers are contraceptive choices only when women of all ages suffer from various health problems. There is no place for women to get health information, and the high number of genital fistulas is an example of this. Gynecologists have previously said that women with the disease often feel ashamed to see a physician and are not well aware of the free treatment available. Education and awareness of sexual health should therefore be an integral part of these national health centers. Public health policy makers must leave this declining view of women's health and expand services for wider sexual and reproductive health. They also need to consider sexual health education for adolescents so that they can make informed choices and become aware of reproductive health concerns. Policy-level silence on sexual health will only increase the risk of unsafe abortion, unwanted pregnancy and other health complications.</p>

                      Young people, adolescents, married or newlyweds, have a relatively good knowledge of reproductive health (RH) but need to know more about how reproductive health concepts are involved, reproductive male and female physiology and other factors related to marital reproductive and sexual health. Not all young people have a clear idea about. Therefore, they could have heard the matter but they are not well informed. Even the window, some can't believe it. Moreover, in some cases when someone is a believer they may not be able to take the necessary action due to embarrassment, fear of consequences or lack of knowledge about where to get help or services. The use of will, demand and increased knowledge is a common attitude among young people, families and community leaders influenced by decisions and health providers. Knowing more is considered a first step in self-defense and a vehicle for ensuring marital health and satisfaction. However, the type is being determined concerns about the social acceptability of opening up to such issues and the potential negative impact of discussing them with adolescents before hiring in general and knowledge about the age cycle are controversial. People from whom young people seek accurate information also need increased knowledge of issues related to reproductive health and family planning. The identified sources are parents, teachers, religious and community leaders and healthcare providers. Teachers acknowledged that they needed more training. Healthcare providers need to be more aware of the risks associated with early pregnancy and knowledge of appropriate family planning methods for young couples. Most of the related studies used secondary data in their research. They have already
                      analyzed the existing data. However, preliminary data were used in the present study.

                      Rural and remote areas are the main problem areas. Schools are the main problem areas. Family planning has remained a top priority in Bangladesh's fourth health sector program in FY 2012-13. Bangladesh has given priority to the implementation of the National Action Plan to address the irrational needs of adolescents through the provision of pre-natural family planning, regional family planning packages in Sylhet and Chittagong divisions and the implementation of the National Adolescent Health Strategy. Bangladesh reconsiders its commitment to end child marriage. To this end, the Bangladesh government will raise $ 155 million for the family planning program between 2013 and 2012, compared to the previous program. Will increase by 67%. Bangladesh intensifies its efforts to increase the number of trained service providers, including: placement of midwives in all sub-district hospitals; Improving family planning services by setting up clinical teams in all districts; And involving the private sector in addressing service and product delivery gaps.

                    FP and RH are facing program implementation and institutional challenges. Suboptimal availability of contraceptives is a major barrier, leading to higher contraceptive breaks due to unplanned pregnancies. Also, contraceptives are funded by most donors and the government should plan for their financial protection in the long run. Of the seven operational plans, the FP and RH services departments weakened the coordination between the two programs, which was further exacerbated by the acute shortage of human resources for health.

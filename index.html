                <p class="para">Child marriage is more prevalent in Bangladesh, so young girls are getting pregnant before they are physically and mentally mature. Although the legal age of marriage is 18 years, the average age of marriage for girls is 14-15 years in Bangladesh. Most young people enter into married life without proper knowledge of reproductive health, contraception and family planning, childbirth decision, infertility, number of children, and appropriate age related to maternal and child health care. Lack of knowledge family planning, they usually start giving birth soon after marriage. These practices lead to pregnancy during adolescence in Bangladesh among the worldâ€™s adolescents. Somewhat unfortunate, though, patients who were physically pregnant approached the pregnant woman; A special inclination is mentioned for elaborate-eclampsia and Buddhist worship. Competition is not complete at the age of 108 and does not end at birth between the ages of 20 and 21. The project shows that adolescence is associate with environmental problems of adolescences, province of advance, anemia, incidence of low birth weight infants and violence of the bribe. Young mothers know very little about their own body or symptoms of danger during pregnancy and childbirth, any savings and plants for childbirth, and they cannot make any decisions on their own. In addition, in the event of an emergency, there is no possibility of a systematic way of getting her pregnancy and childbirth related care. These situations lead many young mothers to death in childbirth and suffer from a pregnancy related illness, illness, injury, or disability. Some injuries, such as fistula, left a young married gild abandoned by her family and left no support. In addition, the target population of the larger population of the beginning of the domestic period, the boundary force involved in the rectangular activity, the higher the number of increasing rates and the lack of vedic and color work. Reviewing these terms, newlyweds have been notified of those involved in better health care practices about health, fortune and birth issues, such as spiritual mobility and healthy living life process. Married adolescent women who want to delay pregnancy may lack autonomy when married capacious children do not want to, but face clear family expectations of becoming pregnant, it may not be that family planning infrastructure fails to meet its needs. Rather, her family may lack the ability to use contraceptives. Greater differences between husbands and their young wives can exacerbate womenâ€™s autonomy issues, reducing young womenâ€™s ability to negotiate with their husbands on gender, contraception and delivery. These multi-country studies have proven that both are more likely to be used by contraceptive partners. Unlike a wife alone wants to prevent childbirth. This section highlights the importance of fertility rates for the future growth of Bangladeshâ€™s population. It describes the family planning (FP) situation at the national and provincial (department) level, with and emphasis on the geographical and socioeconomic disparity of FP and reproductive health (RH) outcomes. This section concludes with an analysis of determinants of fertility (using the Bangerts model in the world) and demonstrates the importance of FP particularly a change in long-acting and permanent contraceptive methods (LAPM) in determining the level of fertility in Bangladesh in the future.</p>

                <h4 id="c1.2">1.2 Motivation</h4>
                    <p class="para">Bangladesh is a developing country. Family planning remains one of the top priorities in Bangladeshâ€™s Fourth Health Sector Program 20, 2017-2012, towards achieving sustainable development goals (2019). Despite past successes, the family planning program in Bangladesh faces several challenges. Also, FP and RH programs face implementation and institutional challenges. Suboptimal availability of contraceptives is a major obstacle, leading to higher contraceptive breaks resulting in unplanned pregnancy. Also, contraceptives are funded mostly by donors, and the government needs to have a plan in place to protect their finances in the long run. The division of FP and RH services across the seven operational plans weakens the coordination between the two programs, which is exacerbated by the acute shortage of human resources for health. So it is very important for all married couples, especially newly married couples, to become move aware of reproductive health and family planning. Promoting family planning and ensuring access to the desired contraceptive system for women and couples is essential to supporting womenâ€™s health and development while protecting womenâ€™s health and autonomy. By reducing the rate of involuntary
                        pregnancy, family planning also reduces the need for unsafe a abortion.</p>

                    <h4 id="c1.3">1.3 Relational of the Study</h4>
                    <p class="para">In many places around the world, family planning programs have made great strides in reducing population growth and improving womenâ€™s reproductive health status by providing services to married couples. Yet in many countries, these programs often reach older women after giving birth to their desired number of children. Even after family planners encourage women to give birth to their family size and enough space, the youngest married couples, especially those whose wife is still under 19, are often overlooked. In most developing countries, most adolescent birth occur within marriage, despite some evidence that the bride and the married couple where the wife forms an important group to obtain information and services on reproductive e health during adolescence. According to young, engaged and newly married youth, reproductive health is a mixture of interventions to protect the health of parents mothers and children. Different groups have referred to different types of contexts that they deem worth of reproductive health problems. Common issues mentioned by all groups are family planning (consultation with physician for appropriate contraceptive use, limit number of children, appropriate interval between pregnancies), pre-maternity testing, prenatal and postnatal healthcare, age appropriate for marriage and pregnancy. Avoiding marriage Avoid hereditary diseases in children, childcare and vaccinations knowledge. Bangladesh has increased its contraceptive tendency rate from less than forty yearsto% 2% in 1979. From 2% in 1970. However, despite these advances, about one-third of pregnancies are still involuntary, which may be responsible for changing family plans and procedures after discontinuation and beginning their use. Family planning programs often do not provide reproductive and sexual health care. Women of all ages, especially teenage girls, are not present. According to a New Age report on Sunday, reproductive health experts expressed concern over the governmentâ€™s program that abandons bride and unmarried but sexually active adolescents. The marriage rate for adolescents is 3 prevent, while the use of contraceptives among adolescents is 5 prevent. The unmet need for contraceptives is even higher among teenagers. Experts attributed the declining quality of service to union-level family planning centers, saying that field staff no longer looked at the door to inform couples about reproductive health and contraceptive choices. It is the responsibility of the Family Planning Department to manage the centers effectively, but it lacks any arrangements to indentify failures.

                        Reviewed a comprehensive literature about contraceptive use in married women of reproductive age in my village. Millions of people live here. Itâ€™s not possible to research on this person, so I research about 50 newly married couples. As a result, I get some results. Less than 50% knows what reproductive health is and what its importance is. They have no idea about reproductive health. They have very little knowledge of family planning. This leads to many problems. One of these is health loss. Abortion is one of the events that is not good for our health and our mind. As a result, they are living precariously. There are two types of uneducated and educated couples. The illiterate couple, however, are even more so. Here education is inevitable. They are living unhealthy lives. New couples in rural areas are indifferent to breeding and family planning. A designed questionnaire containing both closed and open ended queries was prepared to collect data through face to face interviews with respondents. The questionnaire was strode in the region not far from the sample area and was modified according to the field level response. Contraceptive methods were
                        informed, sources of knowledge, and their practices were recorded, and womenâ€™s attitude towards contraception in the form of knowledge involvement of spouse and adoption of contraception was documented in order to obtain relevant information.

                        mentioned directions to improve services. Evidence from these studies has multiple
                        programmatic implications for better monitoring and evaluation of program activities,
                        effective effectiveness in meeting user needs, and more generally, improved
                        efficiency of governments to achieve goals set for total fertility and maternal health
                        services.
                        The questionnaire was verified daily at the time of talking the interview, and after all
                        data was collected, carefully re-examined and coding before entering the computer.
                        Data was edited to look for any errors (suspicious access, incorrect entry, etc).
